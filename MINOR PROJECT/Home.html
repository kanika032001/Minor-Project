         <h5><b><u> GWALIOR FORT</u></b> <br></h5>
            <p>Perched on top of a hill, this imposing and ancient fort is considered one of the most impenetrable forts in 
                the country and is renowned for its great architecture and glorious past. Counted among the best historical 
                places in India, it has a very long and turbulent history, dating back to as far back as 525 AD. Over the years, 
                it was subjected to many attacks and passed hands amongst several different rulers. The fort really rose to 
                prominence under the reign of the Rajput Tomar dynasty and was thereafter built to its current scale and grandeur.
                 The fort houses a number of historic monuments, Hindu and Jain temples, and palaces. A sound and light show held 
                 nightly in the fort's open-air amphitheatre should not be missed.
